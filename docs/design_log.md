# Pulse: Design & Concepts Hub

This document serves as the central hub for all design principles, concepts, and technical plans for the Pulse application. It provides a high-level overview and links to detailed documentation for each specific area.

This modular structure allows for focused discussion and clear, maintainable documentation as the project evolves.

## Core Design Documents

These documents outline the foundational philosophies and specific feature designs of the application.

-   **[Core Principles](./concepts/core_principles.md)**
    -   *A crucial read that outlines the guiding philosophy for data interpretation, the risks of misinterpretation (e.g., "good vs. bad scores"), and the core tenets that ensure Pulse remains a tool for meaningful self-reflection.*

-   **[The Soul's Atlas](./concepts/souls_atlas.md)**
    -   *Details the design and evolution of the central "mandala" visualization, from its initial concept as a "Cosmic Dashboard" to its final, integrated form as the living heart of the sky map. Also covers the design for the archetypal star glyphs.*

-   **[The Prismatic Lenses](./concepts/prismatic_lenses.md)**
    -   *Explores the design concept for representing the three lenses (Ego, Soul, Spirit) as an ambient, atmospheric part of the UI, influencing the background visuals to reflect the user's overall energetic state.*

-   **[Living Nebulas](./concepts/living_nebulas.md)**
    -   *Outlines the design and technical approach for the new, visually rich, borderless nebulas that create an immersive, atmospheric background for the cosmos.*

-   **[Master Prompt Design](./concepts/master_prompt_design.md)**
    -   *Explains the philosophy and structure of the new, sophisticated "master prompt" used to provide deep, holistic context to the Gemini API for generating high-quality, insightful narratives.*

-   **[Visual Aesthetic: Deep Liquid](./concepts/visual_aesthetic.md)**
    -   *Defines the visual direction for Pulse 3.0, moving from a vacuum/space metaphor to an organic, bioluminescent "inner ocean" aesthetic.*

-   **[AI Persona: The Cartographer](./concepts/ai_persona.md)**
    -   *Defines the voice and tone of the AI as a grounded "Field Guide" rather than a mystic oracle.*

## Future Concepts

-   **[Audio Immersion: The Sonic Landscape](./concepts/audio_immersion.md)**
    -   *A technical and creative proposal for integrating generative audio (Tone.js) to create a cinematic, responsive soundscape that evolves with the user's journey.*

## Technical Planning

This document contains the actionable, step-by-step plan for implementing the features outlined in the design documents.

-   **[Technical Implementation Plan](./implementation_plan.md)**
    -   *A phased guide for developers, detailing the required components, utilities, and integrations needed to bring the design concepts to life.*

*This hub document should be updated whenever a new major concept document is created.*
